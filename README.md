# Ferman's Profile

A clean, modern personal profile page for Ferman ([@0xh3rman](https://github.com/0xh3rman)) featuring a brutalist minimalism design.

## Features

- **Brutalist Design:** Raw, unadorned typography with monospace fonts.
- **Dark Theme:** Pure black background with white text and electric cyan accents.
- **Responsive Layout:** Centered layout that works on all screen sizes.
- **Zero Dependencies:** Pure HTML and CSS. No frameworks, no build steps.

## Quick Start

Simply open `index.html` in your browser.

To serve locally with a simple server (optional):

```bash
npx serve .
```

## GitHub Pages Deployment

This repository is optimized for GitHub Pages. Since `index.html` is at the root, it works automatically.

1. Push your changes to the `main` branch.
2. Go to repository **Settings** → **Pages**.
3. Under **Build and deployment** > **Source**, ensure "Deploy from a branch" is selected.
4. Select `main` branch and `/ (root)` folder.
5. Click **Save**.

The site will be live at: **https://0xh3rman.github.io/profile/**
